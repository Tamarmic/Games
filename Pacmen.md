# Pacman Game

## Overview

Welcome to my Pacman game! In this game, you control Pacman, a character who navigates a maze, eating points and avoiding ghosts. You have 3 lives, and each time you eat a point, you score 2 points. Try to collect as many points as possible and survive the ghosts!

## How to Play

1. **Control Pacman**: Use the arrow keys to move Pacman around the maze.
2. **Eat Points**: Navigate the maze and eat the points scattered throughout. Each point is worth 2 points.
3. **Avoid Ghosts**: The ghosts will try to catch Pacman. If a ghost touches you, you lose a life.
4. **Winning and Losing**:
    - **Lose**: The game ends when you lose all 3 lives (if you're caught by the ghosts 3 times).
    - **Win**: Clear the maze by eating all the points before losing all lives.
