# Snake Game

## Overview

Welcome to my Snake Game! In this game, you'll control a snake that slithers around a board. Your goal is to eat the fruits that appear on the board. But be careful! If you touch the walls or the snake runs into itself, the game will end. Each time you eat a fruit, your snake will grow longer, making the game more challenging and exciting!

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's movement.
2. The snake must eat the fruits that randomly appear on the board.
3. Avoid crashing into the walls or the snake's own body.
4. Every time the snake eats a fruit, it gets longer, increasing the difficulty.
5. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or collides with itself.
